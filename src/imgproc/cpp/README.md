**Under development image processing code**

*Requires OpenCV 3*

To build/run:

```bash
$ # Build
$ make
$
$ # Run - this will loop through all the files in image_file.txt (which must)
$ # be absolute paths. Press any key to proceed to the next image. If you wish
$ # to terminate the program before you've gotten to the end of the program,
$ # press the ESC key.
$ ./imgproc image_file.txt
```
